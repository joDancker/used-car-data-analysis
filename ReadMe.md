# second-hand-car-analysis

The project analyzes part of the second hand car market in Sweden to gain insights about the market.

For this, one of the largest websites for second hand cars is scraped for car advertisments of car dealers. From these car advertisments key characteristics of each car are extracted and saved in a *.csv-file for further analysis.
